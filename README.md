# Hangman Game

Hangman game created with Kotlin.  

The user must try to guess a word of variable difficulty in a limited number of attempts, represented by the drawing of a stick figure being hanged. Using the top menu you can choose the difficulty you prefer to play on (more features will be implemented in the future). 

The number of correct words is reflected in the user's score, which increases as the user wins games.
